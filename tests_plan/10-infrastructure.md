if you want to start from a clean situation just
execute [run-build_backbone](../Infrastructure/source/run-build_backbone.ps1)

for as successful execution we need infrastructure dependency up and running so execute in order:

1. [run-infra_for_annotations](../Infrastructure/source/run-infra_for_annotations.ps1)
2. [run annota.api](../scripts/infrastructure/annota.api/run-service.ps1)
